            <h4>Description:</h4>
            This project idea is very simple. I had a lot of problem foucusing for the school stuff. After 30 minutes I bored and I start doing another stuff. That's why I waste so much time. I realized for me it can be good practice to make a softwares. <br>
            That was the first ever big and serious project for me. First version is created with Visual Basic. During the development I consulted with real programmers and I some regular users from my school. I tried find out how many people need that software with some survey, and i tried spread it. Unfourtnetly this software is not a sucsess, thats why I'll rewrite the whole project with C# and WPF technology. I hope the Emfis 1.0 will be way better then 0.9.5
