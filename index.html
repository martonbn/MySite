            <h2>Web Development:</h2><br>
            My programing journy is started from here. For me that was the best way to study how develop those things and fall in <b>love</b> in programing. Thats why you can see very-very old projects to see how I started and where I am right now. You can see my started project some university homeworks and some practice sites.

            When I find out how <b>cool</b> is the programing is I met with Visual Basic. It was a game changer for me. I made my first project witch is a very bad and kind of stupid thing. After I started my first big projects. Here you can see those procjects.

            <h2>Game Development:</h2><br>
            Makeing games is a very big <b>challange</b> for me. Because it's not "just" codeing. You have to understand the game engine. I tried a lot of time but most of the time I give it up. But my friend in the college call me to try join a game jam. After that I tried to do my best being a game developer for a short time.

            <h2>3D Artist:</h2><br>
            I don't know how but I have a little art leaning. I don't know how but i find the blender software. And i realize how cool making 3D stuff. I always tried making renders and game assets. Most of them is dissapier or just not finished. There is a lot of thing witch I finised.<b></b> 
            This is the only thing what i do continuously with codeing. The biggest problem is my coumputer. I never had a good graphics card when I was young thats why most of my project is not the best quality.

            <h2>And Much More:</h2><br>
                Of course there are a lot of good stuff out there. I am a courius person, thats why I did a lot of <b>more things.</b><br>
                <li><b>Graphics Programing</b></li>
                    I am very Interested in Comuputer Graphics. The main reason is very simple. I am an <b>engineer</b> and i want to know how my 3D artist jobs work in the backround. I plan to learn more about that.<br>
                <li><b>UX design</b></li>
                    A good product not just a good backend. I think If we develop something and it's not nice it will be a bad product. Thats why every project <b>have to be nice and easy to use</b>. Thats the main reason why I try making UX/UI designs. It's not the best but I try my best.<br>
                <li><b>Univecity stuff</b></li>
                   I think the university is a very good place to <b>discover</b> new things. I have to do so much thing over there witch is not the most usfullest thing but i did them and i am proud.<br>
