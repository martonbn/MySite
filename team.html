            <h4>Description:</h4>
                This project was my first ever big project. In 2013 I had the idea when we play League of Leagends with my friend and it was really hard find people play with. Thats why i decided to make a site for that problem. I started the development with to frontend. But as you can see I am not the best front end developper. So I decide to download a template.<br><br>
                After that i stutied the backend parts. I used a very old laptop as a server. I used PSQL to treat the data base. I developed a team management section, a team search section where you can filter the teams to nationality to free positions etc. You can join and the and the team leader can judge to accept or decline the join request. I developing it continuously throw years. <br>
                Unfortunately this project is disappear because the server is buged. I had a very old backup from 2016. I never countine that project.
